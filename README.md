# Mission
The mission, goals and overview of Open virtual cycling and our projects.

I am concerned that the market incentives are for each virtual cycling app to create a closed system with lock in and control of the entire vertical business. I think this is bad for the future of virtual cycling. Cycling is unique in how easy it is to crossover between virtual and real world. I think we need to work with real-world cycling organizations to help ensure that the virtual games stay open for all those entities that make cycling awesome in real life. Promoters, Racers, Photography/Video, sponsors, manufactures...

Initial ideas:
* Open platforms that allow riders, racers, promoters, sponsors to participate in an open virtual world.
* Open APIs for developers to build virtual gadgets to enhance the virtual experience.
* Open API that allow promoters to create, setup and manage virtual events, off the primary platform/interface.
* Allow riders to access their real-time and static data
* Allow riders to share access to their data to external entities
* Protect privacy
